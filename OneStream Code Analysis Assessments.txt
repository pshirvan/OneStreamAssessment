Given the following:

 class Animal
 {
    public virtual string speak(int x) { return "silence"; }
 }

 class Cat : Animal
 {
      public string speak(int x) { return "meow"; }
 }

 class Dog : Animal
 {
      public string speak(short x) { return "bow-wow"; }
 }

Question: Explain why the block below does not emit “bow-wow”:
          Animal  d = new Dog(); 
          Console.Write(d.speak(0)); 

Answer: The code outputs "silence" because d.speak(0) invokes the Animal class's speak(int x) method due to method hiding, which is not overridden by Dog's speak(short x).

Given the following:
 class A
 {
     public int a { get; set; }
     public int b { get; set; }
}

class B
{
    public const A a;  
    public B()  { a.a = 10; }
}

int main()
{
    B b = new B();
    Console.WriteLine("%d %d\n", b.a.a, b.a.b);
    return 0;
}

Question: Outline any issues/concerns with the implemented code.

Answer: The code attempts to modify the a property of a const A object within the B constructor, which is not allowed in C# and will result in a compile-time error. Removing the const keywork will fix the issue.
